Increased circulating levels of soluble Fas ligand are correlated with disease activity in patients with fibrosing lung diseases. 
OBJECTIVE: The Fas-Fas ligand (FasL) pathway is one of the important apoptosis-signalling molecule systems. We previously determined that this pathway may be involved in the pathogenesis of fibrosing lung diseases. In the present study, we evaluated the clinical significance of the levels of soluble forms of Fas (sFas) and FasL (sFasL) in serum from patients with fibrosing lung diseases. METHODOLOGY: We measured sFas, sFasL, KL-6 (a measure of alveolar type II cell damage), surfactant protein D (SP-D), and surfactant protein A (SP-A) levels in serum from 35 patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), 17 patients with interstitial pneumonia associated with collagen vascular diseases (CVD-IP), and 13 normal healthy controls using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). RESULTS: The serum levels of sFasL were significantly increased in patients with  active IPF and CVD-IP, compared with those with inactive disease and controls. There was no significant difference in sFasL levels between patients with inactive disease and controls. Serum sFasL levels were significantly correlated with lactate dehydrogenase and KL-6 levels in IPF. The decrease in sFasL levels following corticosteroid therapy was not correlated with the clinical course of IPF. There was no significant difference in serum sFas levels between IPF or CVD-IP patients and controls. CONCLUSIONS: Although further studies need to be performed on a large number of patients with histologically proven IPF or CVD-IP, it would seem that serum sFasL levels may reflect the activity of IPF and CVD-IP.
