The usefulness of monomeric periostin as a biomarker for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. 
The natural course of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is variable. Predicting disease progression and survival in IPF is important for treatment. We previously demonstrated that serum periostin has the potential to be a prognostic biomarker  for IPF. Our aim was to use monomeric periostin in a multicenter study to evaluate its efficacy in diagnosing IPF and predicting its progression. To do so, we developed a new periostin kit to detect only monomeric periostin. The subjects consisted of 60 IPF patients in a multicenter cohort study. We applied monomeric  periostin, total periostin detected by a conventional kit, and the conventional biomarkers-KL-6, SP-D, and LDH-to diagnose IPF and to predict its short-term progression as estimated by short-term changes of %VC and % DL, CO. Moreover, we  compared the fraction ratios of monomeric periostin to total periostin in IPF with those in other periostin-high diseases: atopic dermatitis, systemic scleroderma, and asthma. Monomeric periostin showed the greatest ability to identify IPF comparable with KL-6 and SP-D. Both monomeric and total periostin were well correlated with the decline of %VC and % DL, CO. Clustering of IPF patients into high and low periostin groups proved useful for predicting the short-term progression of IPF. Moreover, the relative ratio of monomeric periostin was higher in IPF than in other periostin-high diseases. Measuring monomeric periostin is useful for diagnosing IPF and predicting its short-term progression. Moreover, the ratio of monomeric periostin to total periostin is elevated in IPF compared to other periostin-high diseases.
