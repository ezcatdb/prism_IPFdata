Fibroblast paracrine TNF-α signaling elevates integrin A5 expression in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). 
BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive lung disease with a poor prognosis. Inflammatory cytokines play a significant role in IPF pathology. However, the fibroblast itself is also believed to be the primary effector in IPF. We hypothesized that the fibroblasts themselves secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines that could propagate IPF by affecting normal neighboring cells. Thus, we explored the effects of IPF fibroblast derived media  on normal fibroblast characteristics. METHODS: Primary IPF/normal tissue derived fibroblast cultures were established and their supernatants were collected (IPF/N-SN, respectively). These supernatants were added to normal fibroblasts. Cell death (caspase-3, western blot), proliferation, viability (WST-1), migration (scratch test) and cell detachment (crystal violet and fibronectin adhesion assays) were tested. 10 inflammatory cytokines were measured by ELISA-based quantitative array. Integrin  α5 (ITGA5), pIκBα, p/total STAT3 levels were measured by western blot/IHC. TNF-α  involvement was confirmed using Infliximab ®, anti-TNF-α mAb. RESULTS: The IPF-SN facilitated fibroblast cell detachment and reduced cell migration (p &lt; 0.05). Nevertheless, these effects were reversed when cells were seeded on fibronectin. The exposure to the IPF-SN also elevated ITGA5 levels, the fibronectin receptor, in addition to NFκB pathway activation (pIκBα↑ 150%, p &lt; 0.05). In accordance, IPF derived fibroblasts were found to express higher ITGA5 than the normal cells (44%↑, p &lt; 0.05). ITGA5 was also expressed in the fibroblastic foci. The IPF-SN contained high TNF-α levels (3-fold, p &lt; 0.05), and Infliximab pretreatment successfully reversed all the above observations. CONCLUSION: We suggest a possible mechanism in which IPF fibroblast secreted TNF-α modifies neighboring fibroblast cell behavior.
