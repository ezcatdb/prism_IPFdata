Acute Exacerbation in Interstitial Lung Disease. 
Acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (AE-IPF) has been defined as  an acute, clinically significant deterioration that develops within less than 1 month without obvious clinical cause like fluid overload, left heart failure, or pulmonary embolism. Pathophysiologically, damage of the alveoli is the predominant feature of AE-IPF which manifests histopathologically as diffuse alveolar damage and radiologically as diffuse, bilateral ground-glass opacification on high-resolution computed tomography. A growing body of literature now focuses on acute exacerbations of interstitial lung disease (AE-ILD) other than idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Based on a shared pathophysiology it is generally accepted that AE-ILD can affect all patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) but apparently occurs more frequently in patients with an underlying usual interstitial pneumonia pattern. The etiology of AE-ILD is not fully understood, but there are distinct risk factors and triggers like infection, mechanical stress, and microaspiration. In general, AE-ILD has a poor  prognosis and is associated with a high mortality within 6-12 months. Although there is a lack of evidence based data, in clinical practice, AE-ILD is often treated with a high dose corticosteroid therapy and antibiotics. This article aims to provide a summary of the clinical features, diagnosis, management, and prognosis of AE-ILD as well as an update on the current developments in the field.
