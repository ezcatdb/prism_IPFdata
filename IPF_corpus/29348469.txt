Treprostinil inhibits proliferation and extracellular matrix deposition by fibroblasts through cAMP activation. 
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is characterized by peripheral lung fibrosis  and increased interstitial extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition. In IPF, tumor growth factor (TGF)-β1 which is the major stimulus of ECM deposition, and platelet derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB is a potent stimulus of fibrosis. Thus,  the effect of Treprostinil on TGF-ß1 and PDGF-induced fibroblast proliferation and ECM deposition was investigated. Human peripheral lung fibroblasts of seven IPF patients and five lung donors were stimulated by PDGF, or TGF-β1, or the combination. Cells were pre-incubated (30 min) with either Treprostinil, forskolin, di-deoxyadenosine (DDA), or vehicle. Treprostinil time dependently activated cAMP thereby preventing PDGF-BB induced proliferation and TGF-β1 secretion. Cell counts indicated proliferation; α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) indicted differentiation, and collagen type-1 or fibronectin deposition remodeling. Myo-fibroblast indicating α-SMA expression was significantly reduced  and its formation was altered by Treprostinil. Collagen type-I and fibronectin deposition were also reduced by Treprostinil. The effect of Treprostinil on collagen type-I deposition was cAMP sensitive as it was counteracted by DDA, while the effect on fibronectin was not cAMP mediated. Treprostinil antagonized the pro-fibrotic effects of both PDGF-BB and TGF-β1 in primary human lung fibroblasts. The data presented propose a therapeutic relevant anti-fibrotic effect of Treprostinil in IPF.
