The CXC chemokines, IL-8 and IP-10, regulate angiogenic activity in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. 
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and often fatal disorder. Fibroplasia and deposition of extracellular matrix are dependent, in part, on angiogenesis. We postulated that an imbalance exists in the expression of angiogenic (IL-8) vs angiostatic (IFN-gamma-inducible protein (IP-10)) CXC chemokines, which favors net angiogenesis in IPF. To test this hypothesis, we obtained open lung biopsies either from normal patients undergoing thoracic surgery for reasons other than interstitial lung disease (control) or from patients with IPF. We found that levels of IL-8 were greater from tissue specimens of IPF patients then from those of controls. In contrast, IP-10 levels  were higher from tissue specimens obtained from control subjects than from those  from IPF patients. When IL-8 or IP-10 was depleted from IPF tissue specimens, tissue-derived angiogenic activity was markedly reduced or enhanced, respectively. Immunolocalization of IL-8 demonstrated that the pulmonary fibroblast (PF) of IPF lung was the predominant cellular source of IL-8. Isolated PF from IPF patients constitutively produced more IL-8 and less IP-10 than control PF. Conditioned media from IPF-PFs demonstrated constitutive angiogenic activity that was attributable, in part, to IL-8. Depletion of IP-10 from IPF-PF  CM resulted in an increase in corneal neovascularization. These findings support  the notion that IL-8 and IP-10 are important factors that regulate angiogenic activity in IPF.
