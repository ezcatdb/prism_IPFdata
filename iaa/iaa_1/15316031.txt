IL-4-induced macrophage-derived IGF-I protects myofibroblasts from apoptosis following growth factor withdrawal. 
The development of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is associated with myofibroblast accumulation and collagen deposition in the lung parenchyma. Recent studies have suggested that the fibroproliferative response is associated with immune deviation toward a T helper cell type 2 (Th2) cytokine profile. In addition, myofibroblast accumulation may be the result of resistance to physiologic apoptosis. If and how these events are linked remain largely unknown. Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) is a fibroblast growth and survival factor that has long been implicated in the pathogenesis of IPF. We have previously shown that interstitial macrophage-derived IGF-I correlates with disease severity in IPF, and the Th2 cytokines interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 stimulate the expression and secretion of IGF-I by macrophages. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that IL-4-induced, macrophage-derived IGF-I protects myofibroblasts from apoptosis. Using a growth factor withdrawal model of apoptosis in the myofibroblast cell line, CCL39, we demonstrate that conditioned  media from IL-4-stimulated macrophages protect myofibroblasts from apoptosis. The survival effect is lost when IGF-I is immunodepleted from macrophage-conditioned  media with IGF-I-specific antibodies. We also show that the protection of myofibroblasts by macrophage-derived IGF-I correlates with and is dependent on the activation of the prosurvival kinases Akt and extracellular signal-regulated  kinase. These findings support the view that IL-4-stimulated, macrophage-derived  IGF-I may contribute to the persistence of myofibroblasts in pulmonary fibrosis in the Th2-deviated environment of the fibrotic lung.
