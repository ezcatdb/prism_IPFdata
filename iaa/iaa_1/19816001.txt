Angiogenic and angiostatic chemokines in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and granulomatous lung disease. 
BACKGROUND: Angiogenesis-angiostasis balance and leukocyte recruitment are influenced by different concentrations of distinct chemokines. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relative contribution of angiogenic and angiostatic CXC chemokines to the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and granulomatous lung diseases, we examined the in vitro production of an angiogenic chemokine (IL-8), and 2 angiostatic chemokines (IP-10 and MIG) by alveolar macrophages. METHODS: Alveolar macrophages from 16 patients with granulomatous lung diseases [8 with sarcoidosis, 8 with extrinsic allergic alveolitis (EAA)], 16 patients with IPF, and 8 control subjects were cultured for 24 h. IL-8, IL-18, IP-10 and MIG in the culture supernatants were measured by a fluorescent bead-based multiplex technique. RESULTS: In IPF patients, IL-8 was increased and correlated with bronchoalveolar  lavage (BAL) neutrophils, whereas the levels of IP-10 and MIG were normal. In sarcoidosis and EAA patients, IL-8, IP-10, and MIG were all increased and IP-10 and MIG correlated with IL-18, a Th1 cytokine, and the percentage and number of BAL lymphocytes. CONCLUSIONS: The difference in the expression of CXC chemokines and a Th1 cytokine may contribute to the different immunopathogenesis, clinical course and  responsiveness to treatment of these diseases.
